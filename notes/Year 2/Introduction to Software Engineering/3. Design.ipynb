    "\n",
    "- The design can meet the requirements\n",
    "- Is it maintainable?\n",

    "### Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Cohesion:__ A mesure of the strenth o fthe realationship between the pieces of functionality within the component. High cohesion has increased understandability, maintainability and reliability.\n",
    "- __Coupling:__ A mesure of the strength of the inter-connection between components. Loose coupling increases understandability and maintainablilty.\n",
    "- __Abstraction:__ A view of some entity that focuses on the infomation relevent to a particular purpose.\n",
    "- __Encapsulation:__ Grouping and packaging the elements and internal details of an abstraction and making those details inaccessible.\n",
    "- __Seperation of interface/implementation:__ Specifing a public interface, known to the clients, separate from the details of how the component is realized.\n",
    "- __Decomposition:__ Divinding large systems into smaller components with distinct responsibilitys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "__Model:__ A precise represntation of some of the information needed to solve a problem using a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A UML model\n",
    "- represented by set of diagrams\n",
    "- structured represnetation too (XML)\n",
    "- must obey rules of UML standard\n",
    "- (fairly) precise meaning\n",
    "- Used informally (talking around whiteboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Big design up front\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often unavoidable\n",
    "- If done right, simplifys developent\n",
    "- Error prone (changing requirements)\n",
    "- Wastefull (mistakes in requirements)\n",
    "\n",
    "XP maxinms:\n",
    "- You aint going to need it\n",
