    "- Users of a system\n",
    "- An external system, which interacts with the system\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually a use case is a sequence of steps, however they may other paths, they may succeed, fail, or succeed in an alternate way.\n",

    "Main success scenario\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Customer selects item\n",
    "2. Customer checks out\n",
    "3. ...\n",

    "```\n",
    "6a. Credit card auth fails\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Identify actors\n",
    "2. For each actor\n",
    "    - What do they need\n",
    "    - Any other expected interactions\n",
    "    - Which use cases have priority\n",
    "    \n",
    "Use cases are often functional requirements, with non-functional requirements attached. Other times. Non-functional requirements apply to subsets or all of use-cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Drive design\n",
    "- Design validation\n",
    "    - Does the design work\n",
    "- Testing\n",
    "    - Good source for system tests\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "- May be to much detail (constraining design)\n",
    "- Supporting actors may not be strictly necessary i.e. librarian may not be involved in borrowing a book (in a modern library)\n",
    "- Less attension to architecture and static object structure.\n",
    "- May miss requirements not associated with actors."
